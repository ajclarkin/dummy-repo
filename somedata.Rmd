```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

### Using GitHub with RStudio

Just a few quick changes because that's what I'm supposed to do.

```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)

x <- c(1:10)
y = floor(runif(10, min=1, max=101))

dd = tibble(x, y)
```

### Do some drawing

Here's a quick line chart of the data generated above.


```{r draw}
dd %>% ggplot(aes(x=x, y=y)) +
  geom_line()
```
